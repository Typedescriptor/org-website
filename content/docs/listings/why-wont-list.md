## Reasons why a package won't list on Typedescriptor

There are numerous reasons why a package or project won't list on Typedescriptor.  This website provides a list of the problems that can occur and solutions for how to resolve them.

Problems are catgorized into three types: blockers, warnings, and informational warnings.

* **Blockers** are problems that must be resolved before the package can be listed on Typedescriptor.  In somewhat rare cases, a moderator can override a blocker to allow a project to list on Typedescriptor.

* **Warnings** are problems that Typedescriptor recommends should be fixed, but which don't prevent listing a package.  In the future, warnings could become blockers, so it is a good idea to address warnings anyway.

* **Informational warnings** are problems that Typedescriptor recommends should be fixed.  These are usually problems that don't affect whether Typedescriptor can list a package or not.
