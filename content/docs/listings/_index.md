Typedescriptor Listings provide a curated list of packages and projects in the .NET ecosystem.

We strive to make Typedescriptor the best place to find and use high quality .NET software.  We use Listings to do just that.

> **Beta Software**  Typedescriptor Listings is in beta.

The editorial staff and moderator team are currently adding a select number of projects to Typedescriptor while it is in its beta period.

There are a few rules in place to keep the quality bar high and the editorial process fair.
