Moderators help keep Typedescriptor up-to-date.

In order to assure high quality on Typedescriptor, we have [several rules](../rules/) in place to look for problems with a project.  When these problems occur, this normally prevents the project from being listed on Typedescriptor.  Sometimes, however, a project is significant or interesting enough that a moderator can use their judgment to skip problems temporarily to unblock the listing.

# Moderators can suggest projects

> **Beta Software**  Typedescriptor Listings is in beta.

During the beta period, a limited number of projects will be added to Typedescriptor.

# Moderators can suppress problems

When problems occur in a listing, a moderator might suppress them in order to unblock the listing.  Reasons why a moderator might suppress:

* **Popularity** &nbsp;&nbsp; The project might be very popular even though it is breaking some of the rules!
* **Feedback from Typedescriptor users**
* **Dependency management** &nbsp;&nbsp; Some packages are transitive dependencies of other packages.  We generally try to list dependencies
* [**Sponsorships**](../sponsorships)
