Sponsorships provide a unique way to promote listings on Typedescriptor.net and engage the community.

Sometimes, Typedescriptor will sponsor a listing.  We sponsor listings that we think are interesting or significant.  This helps to promote them on the Typedescriptor.net website, and it also helps to focus editorial staff and moderators on curating these projects so that they work well with all of Typedescriptor's features.

Sponsorship is also often used together with moderation activities to [suppress problems][1] in order to unblock a listing.
