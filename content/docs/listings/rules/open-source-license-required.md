License for the package or in the repository doesn't look like open source.

## Why Typedescriptor checks for it

Typedescriptor only lists open source software.

## How to fix this problem

* **Use the text of an approved open source license.**  You normally copy the text of the open source license template and fill in the copyright information.  Be careful to avoid editing the text of the license in other places because that may prevent it from being detected as a common open source license.
