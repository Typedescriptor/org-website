The project is not using a supported source control website.

## Why Typedescriptor checks for it

Typedescriptor only works with GitHub.

Today, the source code repository for a package must be on GitHub.  We may revisit whether other popular source code services can be used in the future.

## How to fix this problem

If you can, move the project to GitHub.  Moderators will not be able to ignore this problem, so unfortunately, if the project does not have mirror on GitHub, it won't be able to list on Typedescriptor.
