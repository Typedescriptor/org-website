Project can't be archived.

Normally, owners archive projects when they are no longer interested in maintaining them.

## Why Typedescriptor checks for it

Typedescriptor doesn't list dead projects unless they are particularly vital to the .NET ecosystem.  Archived projects are a very good sign that the project is dead.

## How to fix this problem

Reach out to a moderator if the project is an important .NET project.  If not, then investigate whether the project can be unarchived or forked and re-released.
