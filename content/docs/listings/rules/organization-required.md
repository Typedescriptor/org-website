Project is owned by a user instead of an organization

Generally, only projects within organizations should be listed on Typedescriptor.

## Why Typedescriptor checks for it

Organizations are more likely to have a sustainable, group contibution model that can keep the project high quality, secure, and viable over the long run.

## How to fix this problem

Consider moving the project from a user account to an organization.
